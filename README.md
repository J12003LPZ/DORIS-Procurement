# DORIS Procurement Application

I developed a comprehensive Procurement Application from scratch to streamline the process of requesting and purchasing necessary items. This application was designed to handle multiple user roles and responsibilities efficiently, incorporating all standard procurement functionalities.

## Project Features

- **User and Admin Verification**: A secure verification system that distinguishes between users and administrators, enabling role-based access control.
- **Order Management**: 
  - Users can create, edit, and view orders.
  - Administrators have the authority to approve or reject orders, ensuring proper oversight and accountability in the purchasing process.
- **Full Procurement Workflow**: From order creation to final approval or rejection, the app supports a full end-to-end procurement workflow, providing transparency and efficiency in handling orders.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Backend**: Built using Python and Flask for handling business logic and routing.
  - **Frontend**: Implemented using Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly interface design.
  - **Database Integration**: Full database support to store, manage, and retrieve procurement data, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Professional Impact

For company reasons, I cannot share the source code. Rebuilding this application from the ground up involved a complete overhaul of the previous system, improving its performance, security, and usability. The new system enhances operational efficiency, reduces errors in the order process, and provides a robust solution for managing procurement workflows within the organization.
